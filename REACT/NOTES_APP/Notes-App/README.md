import NotesSlicereducer from './redux/NotesSlice'

export const store = configureStore({
  reducer: {
    note: NotesSlicereducer,
  }
})

💡 This means:
Your global Redux state looks like this:


{
  note: {
    notes: []  // this is inside the 'note' slice
  }
}

2️⃣ Inside your slice (NotesSlice.js):

const initialState = {
  notes: []  // <- this is the property of the state inside the 'note' slice
}
So when your reducer function receives state, it receives only the part managed by this slice, i.e.,


state = {
  notes: []
}

Therefore:
state.notes.push(notes)
is correct, because you are modifying the slice's local state, not the whole global Redux state.

3️⃣ How the global state is updated
Redux does this automatically for you:

✅ You define a reducer for a slice (note).

✅ You update state.notes inside the slice.

✅ Redux internally merges this into the global state under the key note:


// Global Redux state
{
  note: {
    notes: [/* your pushed notes here */]
  }
}
So you access it globally like this:


const notes = useSelector((state) => state.note.notes);
🟢 That’s why you need state.note.notes in your component, but only state.notes in your reducer.
